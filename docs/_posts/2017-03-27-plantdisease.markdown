Human society needs to increase food production by an estimated 70% by 2050 to feed an expected population size that is predicted to be over 9 billion people. Currently, infectious diseases reduce the potential yield by an average of 40% with many farmers in the developing world experiencing yield losses as high as 100%. [[1]][plantvillage]


## Farmer app with diagnosis, advisory and other good stuff

* The mobile and IoT team did an excellent job of making a mobile application on Android that a farmer can use (screenshot below).

* The app is available for download [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ibm.research.camera)

* Of the various cool features that a farmer will now have access through via this app, we are currently working on a plant advisory that brings together farm health monitoring, disease diagnosis and farm credit worthiness.

* We are also looking at leveraging technical text documents to enhance the disease diagnosis of plants!
